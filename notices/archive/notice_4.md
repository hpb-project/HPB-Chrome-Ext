Dear HPB Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake HPB window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. HPB Chrome Extension will never open itself to ask you for your seed phrase, and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to our support email at [hpb@hpb.io](mailto:hpb@hpb.io).
